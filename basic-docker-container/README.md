## Terraform Architectures: Docker Container

The terraform scripts under this folder define the creation of a very simple Docker container so you can use it to get familiar with Terraform. 
Have into consideration that commands have been tested on Mac OSX so they can potentially need to be adjusted for other OS.

Components for this architecture:

- Docker container
- Nginx for port mapping
